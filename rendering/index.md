#### Rendering Images from a Raster

GeoTrellis will render raster data as an image (in png format) for display
on a web map.  It's time to put on your cartographer's cap and consider
how best to represent your data on the map.

Some rasters only have a few unique values.  For example, a raster representing
a rank between 1 and 5 or a landcover raster in which each value is a different
kind of land use (e.g. 11 for water or 40 for forest).  In these cases,
it makes sense to assign each value its own color.  But when raster values
represents counts, measurements, or ratios, there are usually many distinct
values.  One common way to represent raster data visually on a map 
is to divide up the values of the data into different categories called classes,
and then represent each class on the map with its own color.  Each class has
an lower and upper limit that defines what values falls within it.  For example,
a class might contain values between 0 and 10.  We call these limits "class breaks".

When rendering a raster, you can either manually determine the class breaks or
use an automatic classification scheme.  For example, if you were creating a map
of average household income, you might want one of the classes to be defined as 
below the federal poverty guidelines or above the national average.

### Classification

By default, GeoTrellis will create *quantile* class breaks for your raster.  
The intuitive idea of a quantile break is that there should be an equal number of 
cells in each class.  For example, if most cells in our income map have incomes
below the national average, we would generate more classes for that range of
values and only a few classes for higher income ranges, even though those
ranges will have a bigger difference between the low and high limits.  This
classification scheme is particularly good at emphasizing highlights or hotspots
where values are particularly high or low.

Linear breaks simply divides up the values between the lowest value and the
highest value, with the difference between the low and high limit being the
same for each class.  For example, if we want 5 linear breaks between 0 and 50,
the classes would be 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50.

There are other classification schemes that GeoTrellis does not currently
support, such as Natural breaks (Jenk's) and Standard Deviation, but we 
intend to implement them in the future.  Let us know if you have a need.

### Color Ramps

GeoTrellis provides a set of color ramps (a list of colors) for you to choose 
from for representing your rasters to ease the transition from developer to 
cartographer, but you can create your own.  There are many good resources online 
for selecting color ramps.

## DIVERGING COLOR SCHEMES

## Blue to Orange
<div height="250">
<span style="float: right"> <img  src="https://raw.github.com/joshmarcus/geotrellis.github.com/master/rendering/01_blue-to-orange.png" /> </span>
<span>
An 11-step diverging color ramp from blue to gray to orange. The gray critical class in the middle clearly shows a median or zero value. Example uses include temperature, climate, elevation, or other color ranges where it is necessary to distinguish categories with multiple hues.

</div>

## Green to Orange
A 13-step diverging color ramp from green to orange. Example uses include elevation, relief maps, topography, or other color ranges where it is necessary to distinguish categories with multiple hues.

## Blue to Red
A 10-step diverging color ramp from blue to red. Example uses include elections and politics, voter swing, climate or temperature, or other color ranges where it is necessary to distinguish categories with multiple hues.

## Green to Red-Orange
A 10-step diverging color ramp from green to red-orange. Example uses include elections and politics, voter swing, climate or temperature, or other color ranges where it is necessary to distinguish categories with multiple hues.

### SEQUENTIAL COLOR SCHEMES:

Light to Dark - Sunset
An 11-step sequential color ramp showing intensity from light to dark. This color ramp is perfect for showing density where it is critical to highlight very different values with bold colors at the higher, darker end of the ramp. Example uses include population density, accessibility, or ranking.

Light to Dark - Green
A basic 8-step sequential color ramp showing light to dark in shades of green. Example uses include density, ordered data, ranking, or any map where darker colors represent higher data values and lighter colors represent lower data values, generally.

Yellow to Red - Heatmap
An 8-step sequential heatmap from yellow to dark red. Great for heatmaps on a light basemap where the hottest values are more opaque or dark. Also useful for sequential color ranges where the lowest value is the median or zero value.

Blue to Yellow to Red Spectrum - Heatmap
An 11-step heatmap from blue to yellow to red. Great for showing a wide range of values with clear differences in hue.

Dark Red to Yellow-White - Heatmap
A 10-step sequential heatmap from dark red to yellow to white. Great for heatmaps where the hottest values should look more vibrant or intense.

Light Purple to Dark Purple to White - Heatmap
An 8-step sequential heatmap to show intensity with shades of purple with white as the "hottest" value. Great for light or gray basemaps, or where the highest value needs to be called out visually.

### QUALITATIVE OR CATEGORICAL SCHEMES

Bold Land Use
An 8-hue qualitative scheme used to show a clear difference in categories that are unordered or very different. Example uses include zoning, land use, land cover, or maps where all categories or groups are equal in visual strength/magnitude.

Muted Terrain
An 8-hue qualitative scheme used to show different kinds of map topology or features. This is generally used to show landforms, terrain, and topology.


### Code examples

### RGBA vs RGB values

One way to represent a color is as an RGB hex value, as often seen in CSS or
graphics programs.  For example, the color red is represented by "#FF0000".
Internally to GeoTrellis, colors are represented as ARGB values, which includes
a value for transparency.  These can be represented as an 8 character string
(with the alpha opacity value being the first two charcters) such as "#FFFF0000"
for opaque red.  When using the programming interface, just be sure to keep the
distinction in mind as they are not interchangable, but there are utility methods
for converting back and forth.
